# 🚀 Getting started

Studia backend is completelly build in Strapi. Strapi is a headless CMS, which means that it is a content management system that does not have a built-in frontend. This gives you the freedom to build your frontend using any technology stack that you want. Strapi is also open-source and based on Node.js, which makes it a great choice on building scalable and secure applications.

### `develop`

Start your Studia application with autoReload enabled. [Learn more](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.html#strapi-develop)

```
npm run develop
# or
yarn develop
```

## ⚙️ Deployment

The backend is deployed using Render a serverless hosting hosting platform that makes it easy to deploy and scale web applications. Render takes care of all the infrastructure management, so you can focus on building your application. All the data is stored in Cloudinary a cloud-based image and video management service that provides a variety of features for storing, transforming, and delivering media assets.
